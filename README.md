The author believes that the introduction of generative AI in fintech industry is not a good idea, as the risk of using generative AI without a clear understanding of how it works is too high (in other words, it is difficult for us to effectively regulate it). Financial firms must therefore consider the impact of misinformation on their business when considering using these tools.

People are very irrational about money, so financial advisors need to be able to analyze emotions. This is something that LLMs cannot do.The current generative AI still has problems such as generating false content, etc., which is unacceptable to the financial domain.

Fintechnexus's [Generative AI Adoption at Banks:  Opportunities for Fintechs?](https://www.fintechnexus.com/generative-ai-adoption-at-banks-opportunities-for-fintechs/) gives a different view. It shows that many financial companies have begun to introduce generative AI and use such tools to improve operational efficiency and drive revenue growth. Although it may face some challenges, but its excellent data analysis capabilities and fraud detection capabilities are exactly what the financial industry needs.

The article lists concerns about data privacy among the financial firm's clients, but quotes consultant Livingston as adding that having purpose-built generative AI could address these issues. Google Cloud executives are also optimistic about such challenges.
